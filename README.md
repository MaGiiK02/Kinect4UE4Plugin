# Kinect4UE4Plugin

    This is a Kinect plugin for UE4.

    The version of Kinect is 1.8,and the version of  unreal engine is 4.5.0.
    If u want to Kinect2.0 version plugin or unrel engine 4.5.1 or later.

    U can just visit here:

    If u download the plugin and just rebuild you unreal engine,and in you new game,u have to choose u game mode as 
KinectGameMode ,then u can use the kinect plugin.

Remembr:
    You need to change the file name as same the plugin name ,so change the file name as "Kinect18Plugin",then
generate you unreal engine project(just double click the GenerateProjectFiles.bat file,then build the engine with visual studio).
   So is ok!

   Otherwise ,u can also change the code to made the plugin more improve and perfect.
